# Welcome!

This is a work in progress!

This project provides an example setup and usages of blade [Daisy Components](https://github.com/mister-simon/daisy-components).


## Note

This is still in development - notice that the composer file currently contains:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "../daisy-components"
    }
],
```

Eventually I intend to make that package available via composer... But for now if you want to actually run this project locally with the daisy-components package you will need to find your own way around that.
